## Key Insights
1. Churn Rate Analysis
A significant portion of customers have churned (churn = 1), as shown in the pie chart, highlighting the need for better retention strategies.

2. Age Group and Churn Trends
The 26–35 age group has the highest churn rate, followed by 46–55, while churn is lower for 18 and below and above 55.

3. Product Ownership Impact
Customers with fewer products (1–2) churn more often. Promoting additional product ownership could improve retention.

4. Regional Churn Distribution
Some regions show higher churn rates, as indicated on the map, requiring localized retention efforts.
